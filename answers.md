Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

•The client DriverPass wanted us to create a website that offered driving courses, tests and in person driving lessons to individuals planning to receive their driver’s license. They wanted a cloud-based system (with downloadable offline capabilities) that could be accessed from anywhere and could use the users personal DMV requirements to create a regimen that was catered to them specifically, connecting them to an admin that could track and update their progress. They also wished for students to be able to call into the Secretary who could update the system and book an in person driving test and select their desired vehicle if available.

What did you do particularly well?

•I believe I did a good job in creating UML and Class diagrams for the project because I made sure that the steps shown were easy to follow and understand and showed viewers the exact progression that the program was meant to take. I was quite pleased with how my final product came out, as both experienced developers and people unfamiliar with the business could look at the diagrams laid out and understanding exactly what the program was meant to do.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

•I would do a better job describing the diagrams individually, as I mistakenly thought that doing a general summary of the program as a whole at the end would be enough to explain what was going on in the diagrams. I should have to isolated each individual diagram and highlighted exactly what was being shown as to avoid any confusion.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

•I used the information told to us directly in the client requirements meetings that laid out what they expected from the project and how the user was meant to interface with the program. Putting myself in the shoes of all of the roles for this project including tester and developer meant looking at the project from the point of view of the potential users and deciding what the demographic who is likely to use the website would be looking for and what they would be disappointed wasn’t included. The users are going to be the ones interacting with the website and if they don’t feel comfortable or like they are getting what they paid for in terms of quality and interactivity, they will not be pleased, meaning in turn the client will not be pleased. It is important to ensure that the customers using the website are satisfied with what they are paying for or the client will ultimately experience diminishing returns on their investment.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

•It is important to lay out a solid plan of attack before anything else, creating sequence models, object models, and UML diagrams as well as having our game plan laid out in the initial kickoff meetings and sprint planning. When it is time we can begin the official sprint, laying out our goals decided in the sprint planning meeting and creating a backlog that details each groups  steps and their current progress toward their goals. We would have daily sand up meetings to convene with each other, share ideas, and update our progress. When we felt that the project was adequate we would hold a sprint review with the client and shareholders in order to lay out what was exactly we have done and how it meets the clients desires, listing to any feedback provided. Finally we would have a sprint retrospective in order to see what about the scrum process went well and what could be improved for next time.
